Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment tool. It runs on many Unix-like systems, and can configure both Unix-like systems as well as Microsoft Windows. It includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration.
This is similar to what bitbucket uses for their pipeline but not sure if they are the same stuff, although both uses YAML.
