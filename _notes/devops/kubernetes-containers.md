Programs running on Kubernetes are packaged as Linux containers. Containers are a widely accepted standard, so there are already many pre-built images that can be deployed on Kubernetes.

Containerization allows you to create self-contained Linux execution environments. Any program and all its dependencies can be bundled up into a single file and then shared on the internet. Anyone can download the container and deploy it on their infrastructure with very little setup required. Creating a container can be done programmatically, allowing powerful CI and CD pipelines to be formed.

Multiple programs can be added into a single container, but you should limit yourself to one process per container if at all possible. Itâ€™s better to have many small containers than one large one. If each container has a tight focus, updates are easier to deploy and issues are easier to diagnose.
