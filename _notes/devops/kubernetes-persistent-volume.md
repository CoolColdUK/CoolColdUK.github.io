Because programs running on your cluster aren’t guaranteed to run on a specific node, data can’t be saved to any arbitrary place in the file system. If a program tries to save data to a file for later, but is then relocated onto a new node, the file will no longer be where the program expects it to be. For this reason, the traditional local storage associated to each node is treated as a temporary cache to hold programs, but any data saved locally can not be expected to persist.

To store data permanently, Kubernetes uses Persistent Volumes. While the CPU and RAM resources of all nodes are effectively pooled and managed by the cluster, persistent file storage is not. Instead, local or cloud drives can be attached to the cluster as a Persistent Volume. This can be thought of as plugging an external hard drive in to the cluster. Persistent Volumes provide a file system that can be mounted to the cluster, without being associated with any particular node.
