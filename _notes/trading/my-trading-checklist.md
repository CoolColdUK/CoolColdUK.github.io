## Stock trading
Stocks are affected by the amount of money in the market, and this can be observed via FTSE. Therefore it is important to consider the general FTSE trend before trading. To pick a stock to trade, always follow the following checklist
1. Find market direct from FTSE daily
2. Find stock direction or potential direction
3. Trade only if the direction matches both FTSE and stock
4. Use lower timeframe for entry
