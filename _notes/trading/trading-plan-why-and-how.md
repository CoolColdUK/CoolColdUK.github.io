## Basics Of Trading
The aim of most people for trading stocks or commodities is to make money. No matter what the reason behind it, be it to find the holy grail, or to have financial freedom. In order to make money, one has to buy the commodity at low price, and sell at high price.

## Who determine the price
The price of commodities are determined by the market. This is a supply and demand question. If the traders, be it retail or not, think the value of the commodity should be higher, they will pay more. This is like a voting system, but voting with dollar. The more dollar one has, the higher the voting power and thus the price will likely go the way decided by the majourity of the vote. Similarly if a rich entity decided to join a market, they will pay more to enter the game and causing a price increase.

## How does other factor affect the price
A company with good profit, or news can lead to price increase, but ultimately it is the market that make the final decision. If a company has good news release, but the market does not trust them, the price will not go up. Similarly for bad news but the market thinks they will do better in the future, the price can still go up.
