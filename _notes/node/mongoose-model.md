The model represents a collection of documents in the database that you can search, while the model's instances represent individual documents that you can save and retrieve.

Models are fancy constructors compiled from Schema definitions. An instance of a model is called a document. Models are responsible for creating and reading documents from the underlying MongoDB database.
